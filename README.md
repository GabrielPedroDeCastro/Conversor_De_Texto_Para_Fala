## Using pyttsx3

An application invokes the pyttsx3.init() factory function to get a reference to a pyttsx3.Engine instance. During construction, the engine initializes a pyttsx3.driver.DriverProxy object responsible for loading a speech engine driver implementation from the pyttsx3.drivers module. After construction, an application uses the engine object to register and unregister event callbacks; produce and stop speech; get and set speech engine properties; and start and stop event loops.

## The Engine factory

pyttsx3.init([driverName : string, debug : bool]) â†’ pyttsx3.Engine
Gets a reference to an engine instance that will use the given driver. If the requested driver is already in use by another engine instance, that engine is returned. Otherwise, a new engine is created.
